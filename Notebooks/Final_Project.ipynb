    "### 1. Einleitung\n",
    "Heutzutage werden Nachrichten über unterschiedliche Medien an die Masse verteilt. Ein Medium ist zum Beispiel die sozialen Medien. Einerseits führen der einfache Zugang und die schnelle Verbreitung von Nachrichten dazu, dass viele Menschen die Nachrichten konsumieren. Auf der anderen Seite aber wird  die schnelle Verbreitung von \"Fake Nachrichten\" begünstigt. Fake Nachrichten sind Nachrichten von geringer Qualität und mit absichtlich falschen Informationen.  Die weite Verteilung von Fake Nachrichten kann extrem negative Auswirkungen auf Individuen und die Gesellschaft haben (Shu et al, 2017). Daher ist die Erkennung solcher Nachrichten von hoher Relevanz."

    "In diesem Projekt werden wir die Hauptprobleme bei der Erkennung von Fehlinformationen analysieren und diskutieren. Wir werden mittels statistischen Methoden unterschiedliche Nachrichten untersuchen. Diese Nachrichten sind bereits in \"richtig\" und \"falsch\" kategorisiert. \"Richtig\" bedeutet, dass die Nachrichten der Wahrheit entsprechen, \"falsch\" bedeutet das Gegenteil.\n",

    "- Pandas provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for Python. It's main datastructure is the numpy-array-based dataframe, which is comparable to dataframes in R. Actually, with Pandas Python provides similar functionality as R. The Pandas Website states it as follows: Python has long been great for data munging and preparation, but less so for data analysis and modeling. pandas helps fill this gap, enabling you to carry out your entire data analysis workflow in Python without having to switch to a more domain specific language like R\n",
    "\n",
    "- NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific calculation in Python. It provides a multi-dimensional datastructure, the numpy-array, and many efficiently implemented functions for numerical calculations. Many other important libraries for scientific calculation and data analysis are based on Numpy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scipy is based on and extends the functionality of numpy with packages for linear algebra, integration, optimisation, signal processing, statistics and much more. Python with Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib constitutes a comprehensive tool for scientific calculations of all types. This bunch provides functionality comparable with the commercial tool Matlab\n",
    "\n",
    "- Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shell, the jupyter notebook, web application servers, and for graphical user interface toolkits.\n",

    "Visualisation:\n",

    "- Bokeh is an interactive visualization library for Python that enables beautiful and meaningful visual presentation of data in modern web browsers. With Bokeh, you can quickly and easily create interactive plots, dashboards, and data applications."
